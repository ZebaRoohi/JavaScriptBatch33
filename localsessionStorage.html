    <h3>Example of local and session storage</h3>
    <p>localStorage:
        Data stored in localStorage persists even when the browser is closed and reopened. It remains until explicitly cleared by the user or the web application.
        localStorage is suitable for storing data that needs to be persistent across multiple sessions.
        sessionStorage:
        Data stored in sessionStorage is only available for the duration of the page session. If the user closes the tab or the browser, the data is cleared.
        sessionStorage is useful when you want to store temporary data that should only persist for a single browsing session.</p>
