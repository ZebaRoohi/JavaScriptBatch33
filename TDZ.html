    <h3>Temporal Dead Zone</h3>
    <p>A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value.
        Suppose you attempt to access a variable before its complete initialization. In such a case, JavaScript will throw a ReferenceError.
        So, to prevent JavaScript from throwing such an error, you've got to remember to access your variables from outside the temporal dead zone.</p>

    console.log(x)
    //TDZ exist here
    //TDZ exist here
    //TDZ exist here
   //TDZ exist here
    //TDZ exist here

    let x='Temporal Dead Zone'
    console.log(x)
    //TDZ does not exist here
    //TDZ does not exist here
    //TDZ does notexist here
    //TDZ does not here
