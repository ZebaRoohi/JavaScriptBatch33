    <h3>block and Function scope</h3>
    <p>In function scope, variables are defined within a function and are accessible only within that function. If a variable is declared inside a function using var, it is hoisted to the top of the function, meaning you can use it before its actual declaration.</p>
    <p>Block scope refers to the scope of variables within a block, which is usually denoted by curly braces {}. Unlike var, variables declared with let and const are block-scoped. This means that they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined.</p>
